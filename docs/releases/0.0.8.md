# Release 0.8 (in progress)

## Mix point editor
- New PFL mix-point dialog (`Loop` context menu → `Mix points…`) with slider, keyboard nudges, and preview shortcuts for setting cue-in, intro/outro, segue, and overlap values.
- Each point can be toggled via checkbox; when enabled, values are stored in dedicated APEv2 tags (`SARA_CUE_IN`, `SARA_INTRO_END`, `SARA_OUTRO_START`, `SARA_SEGUE_START`, `SARA_OVERLAP_DURATION`) without touching legacy SPL tags.
- Overlap rows allow overriding the default crossfade by defining an explicit duration; segue rows use the absolute cursor position but are stored relative to the cue-in mark.

## Metadata & automation
- `extract_metadata` now prefers SARA mix-point tags but still falls back to SPL/ID3 values so existing libraries keep working.
- Auto-mix uses the optional outro point when no explicit segue exists (fade begins at `outro - overlap`).
- Clipboard serialization for playlist items preserves the new mix-point values.

## Preview/UX
- PFL preview helpers were generalized (shared between the loop dialog and the new mix editor) so playback stops cleanly when swapping devices or leaving the dialog.
- `New playlist` dialog focuses the name field automatically (carried forward from 0.0.7), and the first playlist regains focus after startup.

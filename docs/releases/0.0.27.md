# 0.0.27

## Changes

- Fix: avoid UI freezes when playback updates run while focus is on another panel (reduce playlist refresh work).
- Fix: NVDA no longer gets briefly silenced during navigation / Play Next (remove legacy speech cancels and reduce noisy updates).
- Fix: track-end alert beep is reliable even during active PFL preview (dedicated player instances + preview context cleanup).
- Fix: folder preview toggle no longer requires a “double press” after preview ends.

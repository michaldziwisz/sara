# Release 0.10 (in progress)

## Manual mixing
- Manual queues now fade out the currently playing track using the configured overlap instead of cutting playback abruptly when Auto Mix is disabled.
- Crossfade tracking was unified, so queued selections and Auto Mix share the same protection against duplicate fades.

## Shortcuts & accessibility
- Added a global “Track remaining time” command (Ctrl+Alt+T) that announces the current track’s countdown; it also reacts to the Right Alt (AltGr) + T combination used on Polish keyboard layouts.
- The shortcut is available from the Tools menu and can be customized through the shortcut editor like other global commands.

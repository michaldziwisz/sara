# Release 0.7

## Highlights
- **Playlist management dialog facelift.** The File → Manage playlists window now mirrors the startup playlists UX: multi-column list (name/type/player count), Add/Remove/Configure buttons, and Move Up/Down controls. You can now edit device assignments directly there, reusing the same device picker that the options dialog uses.
- **Consistent device workflow.** Creating a playlist (via File → New playlist or the manage-dialog Add action) immediately offers the device assignment dialog, so freshly added playlists are ready for playback. Device assignments made anywhere (menu, options, manage dialog) reuse the same helper and persist automatically.
- **Focus and navigation polish.** The top-most playlist regains focus when the UI boots, the “New playlist” dialog focuses the name field, headers above each playlist no longer trap focus, and news playlists expose predictable Tab / Shift+Tab behavior (tabbing cycles through text → toolbar → next playlist, Shift+Tab returns in reverse order). F6 remains the dedicated “cycle playlists” shortcut.
- **News playlist accessibility tweaks.** Toolbar navigation no longer blocks Shift+Tab from escaping to the previous playlist, and read/edit panes cooperate with toolbar focus so screen readers stay silent only where needed.

## NVDA / accessibility
- News playlist toolbar buttons now honour Tab/Shift+Tab ordering without stealing focus from other playlists; announcements are refreshed when switching playlists due to the new static headers.

# 0.0.31

## Changes

- Feature: playlist timing now reflects on-air playtime based on cue-in + configured mix points (segue/overlap) or fallback fade, instead of file length.
- Performance: automix preloads the next track (BASS stream reuse + cache warm-up fallback) to reduce start latency around mix points on slow storage.
- Performance: PFL mix preview also preloads track B so preview timing matches on-air playback 1:1.
- Docs: add developer docs for track timing + preloading (see `docs/development/track_timing.md` and `docs/development/audio_preloading.md`).

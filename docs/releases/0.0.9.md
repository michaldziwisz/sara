# Release 0.9 (in progress)

## Mix point editor
- New PFL mix-point dialog (`Loop` context menu → `Mix points…`) with slider, keyboard nudges, and preview shortcuts for setting cue-in, intro/outro, segue, and overlap values.
- Each point can be toggled via checkbox; when enabled, values are stored in dedicated APEv2 tags (`SARA_CUE_IN`, `SARA_INTRO_END`, `SARA_OUTRO_START`, `SARA_SEGUE_START`, `SARA_OVERLAP_DURATION`) without touching legacy SPL tags.
- Overlap rows allow overriding the default crossfade by defining an explicit duration; segue rows use the absolute cursor position but are stored relative to the cue-in mark.
- Added a bs1770gain-powered loudness section: pick EBU R128 or ATSC A/85, normalize the file directly from the dialog, and the computed ReplayGain (`REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN`) is written in SPL-compatible form.

## Metadata & automation
- `extract_metadata` now prefers SARA mix-point tags but still falls back to SPL/ID3 values so existing libraries keep working.
- Auto-mix uses the optional outro point when no explicit segue exists (fade begins at `outro - overlap`).
- Clipboard serialization for playlist items preserves the new mix-point values.
- ReplayGain tags can be updated manually or via normalization; metadata helper `save_replay_gain_metadata()` keeps SPL-compatible values in `REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN`.

## Preview/UX
- PFL preview helpers were generalized (shared between the loop dialog and the new mix editor) so playback stops cleanly when swapping devices or leaving the dialog.
- `New playlist` dialog focuses the name field automatically (carried forward from 0.0.7), and the first playlist regains focus after startup.
- Removed the old “selection mode” – the Space bar now always plays either the queue of manually selected tracks or, when nothing is queued, the currently highlighted track.
- Manual playback remembers the last started row, so repeated presses of Space continue down the list (wrapping to the top) and immediately pick up tracks pasted beneath the current item.
- Auto-mix now starts from the focused row, cycles through the entire playlist (looping back to the top), and no longer steals keyboard focus so you can browse tracks freely while it runs.
- While AutoMix is enabled, queuing specific tracks is disabled (to avoid conflicts); turn off AutoMix to build a manual queue.

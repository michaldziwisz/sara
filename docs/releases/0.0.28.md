# 0.0.28

## Changes

- Fix: track-end alert beep plays again (repair importlib.resources path for bundled WAVs).
- Fix: BASS automix trigger is more reliable near track end (SYNC_MIXTIME + end-of-stream fallback; one-shot guard).
- Fix: crossfade fade-out now dispatches “finished” callback, preventing stale playback contexts and delayed automix.

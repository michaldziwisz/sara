# 0.0.24

## Changes

- Refactor: split the large UI and audio modules into smaller subpackages to improve long-term maintainability (no intended behaviour changes).
- Fix: restore `Space` preview handling for music folder playlists (it no longer falls through to the global "Play next" shortcut).
- Fix: guard auto-mix next-item index handling to avoid out-of-range errors.
- Tests: extend headless-first coverage for the refactor and keep backward-compatible import shims verified.

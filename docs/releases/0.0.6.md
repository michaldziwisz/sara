# Release 0.6

## Highlights
- Multi-selection (previously marker mode): `Ctrl+Enter` toggles selection, `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` enables selection mode, `Play Next` prioritises selected tracks and deselects after playback; NVDA announces selection state.
- Artist + title from tags now visible in playlist columns, NVDA speech, context menus, and exports.
- Loop/intro playback silence logic rewritten: arrow keys and space have dedicated NVDA handling via the `sara-silent` add-on; playlist NVDA focus fixes.
- News playlists: Markdown editor + read-only mode with `Ctrl+E`, audio markers `[audio:...]`, line length setting, device selection, audio playback buttons (Enter/Space), navigation via `H`/`Shift+H`, `C`/`Shift+C`; clipboard paste for audio files with Windows drops, `Ctrl+E` toggles edit/read, `F6` cycles playlists skipping controls.
- Standalone Sara News Editor: same Markdown/audio workflow, device persistence, line length control, `Ctrl+E` toggles edit/read, Tab navigation between toolbar controls. Config stored under `config/sara-news-editor.yaml`.
- Clipboard operations: filtering of `.mp3.reapeaks`/non-audio files, asynchronous metadata loading with BusyInfo spinner for `Ctrl+D`, import M3U, and paste from Explorer (no UI freezing). Pasted files announce skipped items.
- Custom file picker (`FileSelectionDialog`) replaces Windows `FileDialog` everywhere (SARA & Sara News Editor) – supports filters, multi-select, remembers last folder, Backspace cycles directories/drives, Enter on file equals OK.
- SoundDevice backend can now play MP4/M4A audio by transcoding through FFmpeg (FFmpeg bundled on Windows, keep it on `PATH` elsewhere).
- NVDA add-on refinements: strzałki always read, Space/F1 silent during Play Next, plugin respects `Sara.exe`, arrow hook removed, new selection announcements.
- Shortcut capture dialog (wx) compatibility fixes: `GetAffirmativeButton`, `WXK_RAW_CTRL` replaced, key capture rewritten.
- Loop playback/resume logic fixes: selection toggling resets statuses, no forced `reset_from`.
- Auto-mix uses selected playlists first when selection mode enabled.
- COM warnings from pycaw suppressed, audio metadata loader parallelised via ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up large imports.
- Options dialog: startup playlist list now accepts news playlists; README updated with 0.0.6 references.

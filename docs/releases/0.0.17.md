# 0.0.17

## Changes

- Loudness normalization: handle bs1770gain outputs without XML/with missing stdout; retry via ASCII-only temporary copy for edge-case files.
- Manual queue playback: starting a queued track now clears its queued marker immediately; after a track ends, the next queued selection starts even if no mix trigger fired.

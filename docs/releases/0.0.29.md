# 0.0.29

## Changes

- Feature: add MPEG playback support (`.mpg`, `.mpeg`) via FFmpeg audio-only transcoding (DeviceMixer + BASS fallback).
- Fix: loudness normalization now works for MPEG sources (transcode-to-WAV fallback for bs1770gain).
- Fix: mix timing uses `ffprobe` duration for MPEG sources when metadata lacks length.
- UI: file pickers include MPEG extensions.
